# nonbiri-dev

Work-in-progress. This README contains information regarding the development of this project, mostly about crucial things which I don't want to forget.

## Development

The following packages are required to build this project on debian-based linux distro.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
$ sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common build-essential git sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev cmake make
```

For Windows, Visual Studio 2019 and CMake are required. Just make sure that you set the path environment properly (continued later since I forgot about how things works on WIndows).
